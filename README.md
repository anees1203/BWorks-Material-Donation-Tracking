## Donator:

+ Name
+ E-mail
+ Bike model
+ Bike wheel size
+ Other parts of the bike
+ Drop of locations
+ Condition of bike (new, good, fair)


## Database:
According to the condition of the bike, the inventory for the bike and the data of Donar are allocated.
The new and good-condition bike is stored in a separate inventory (just in need of inspection or minor repairs; hence, it takes less time to deal with) and is ready for donation to children. The fair conditions are required to be investigated more deeply.
